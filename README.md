# ATLAS Phase-II eFEX/GEP Classifier Framework

This repository provides a framework to **train, test, and evaluate classifier algorithms** using **Scikit-Learn and XGBoost** for **electron/photon discrimination** in the **eFEX and Global Event Processor (GEP)** systems of the **ATLAS Phase-II trigger upgrade**.

## Features
- Full pipeline for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Tested with multiple binary classifiers using SK-Learn and XGBoost.
- Includes performance benchmarking and model export utilities.

## Requirements
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Large File Storage) must be installed and enabled prior to cloning.  
  Data files tracked via Git LFS are included in this repository.

## Usage Notes
- Designed for **Windows OS** environments.
- Please **clone the repository into a high-level directory** to avoid path length limitations (especially on Windows).
- Further code and documentation updates are in progress for improved clarity and maintainability.

## Status
- Minor updates and documentation refinements ongoing.
